        ◈ Legendary Returner's Survival Guide
      </h2>

      <div class="garis"></div>

      <h2 class="garis2">Chapter 15</h2>

      <p>
        The camera director chimed in, “I also think it’s insane. I can't believe their audacity. You know how the Awakener Association created and distributed the gate
        detection devices, right?”<br /><br /><br />

        “I do,” Natalie answered.<br /><br /><br />

        “Lately, there have been multiple malfunctions. Some are speculating that they’re trying to cover it all up by taking a gamble. You know, those conspiracy theories?
        The ones about them manipulating Gate Values to funnel gates toward certain guilds.”<br /><br /><br />

        It was nothing new.<br /><br /><br />

        A guild’s eligibility to bid on a gate depended on the gate’s Rank and the detection device’s assigned value.<br /><br /><br />

        If someone could artificially control those values, the device itself would become a weapon.<br /><br /><br />

        “Should we investigate?” Natalie’s eyes lit up, but the director shook his head.<br /><br /><br />

        “Like I said, it’s just a conspiracy theory. Several reporters have already tried and given up. Don’t waste your time.”<br /><br /><br />

        Natalie shrugged.<br /><br /><br />

        Then, slowly, she turned her head toward the Uyuni Salt Flat, and the enormous, shimmering form beside it—the SSS Rank Gate.<br /><br /><br />

        She froze. Her entire body locked up.<br /><br /><br />

        What was this?<br /><br /><br />

        “…Why is it doing that?”<br /><br /><br />

        Following Natalie’s gaze, the director turned and checked the gate.<br /><br /><br />

        “What the…? Why did it stop?”<br /><br /><br />

        The gate had stopped shimmering, meaning someone must have gone inside.<br /><br /><br />

        But how?<br /><br /><br />

        The director quickly stood up and checked the camera. Because it had been recording, he could instantly review the footage.<br /><br /><br />

        His expression hardened.<br /><br /><br />

        “Well? What is it? Did you see anyone?” Natalie asked.<br /><br /><br />

        “…No. There’s nothing. The Gate just stopped on its own.”<br /><br /><br />

        “How does that make sense?”<br /><br /><br />

        “…You’re right. It doesn’t.”<br /><br /><br />

        Everyone present stared blankly at the gate.<br /><br /><br />

        Those watching on TV did the same.<br /><br /><br />

        Around the world, everyone stared, bewildered, at the gate that had ceased its shimmering.<br /><br /><br />

        * * * Folding space was a more accurate description than folding the ground.<br /><br /><br />

        Shi-hu stopped near the Bolivia Gate, then grabbed his sister’s head with one hand and her waist with the other.<br /><br /><br />

        “What are you doing?” she asked.<br /><br /><br />

        “Holding you. Otherwise, you’ll break your neck and back.”<br /><br /><br />

        He was serious.<br /><br /><br />

        And just like that, Shi-hu launched himself from the ground.<br /><br /><br />

        Fwoop.<br /><br /><br />

        A faint sound echoed as Song-yi’s vision blurred and the world shifted around her.<br /><br /><br />

        In the blink of an eye, she was inside the gate.<br /><br /><br />

        As Shi-hu released her, a delayed wave of pain washed over Song-yi.<br /><br /><br />

        There was a stinging sensation on her skin, like her body hadn't adapted to the sheer velocity.<br /><br /><br />

        He was already so far beyond human limitation.<br /><br /><br />

        Despite being a transcendent, officially recognized by the System as beyond her own species, Song-yi felt pain from a single movement of her younger brother.<br /><br /><br />

        Haah.<br /><br /><br />

        “…Nothing surprises me anymore,” she muttered.<br /><br /><br />

        Shi-hu didn’t respond. He just smiled.<br /><br /><br />

        The two of them looked around.<br /><br /><br />

        The first thing of notice was the massive waterfall before their eyes.<br /><br /><br />

        They were in a forest.<br /><br /><br />

        The air was cool, as if it were autumn.<br /><br /><br />

        As Shi-hu surveyed their surroundings, Song-yi focused on a point in the air.<br /><br /><br />

        She didn’t hear her brother ask what she was looking at.<br /><br /><br />

        Understandably.<br /><br /><br />

        [Phase 1.<br /><br /><br />

        Bhavacakra(Wheel of Life): The Three Poisons - Raga(Greed)<br /><br /><br />

        Rank: SSS<br /><br /><br />

        Time Limit: 72 Hours<br /><br /><br />

        Upon failure, this gate will immediately explode.]<br /><br /><br />

        This was very different.<br /><br /><br />

        She had seen various gates with time limits, but never one so short as 72 hours.<br /><br /><br />

        They usually allowed at least 100 hours or more, yet the highest-ranked gate to date—SSS Rank—had only 72 hours to clear it?<br /><br /><br />

        She was speechless. But that wasn’t all.<br /><br /><br />

        If she failed to clear the gate, the gate would explode? What kind of devastation would the explosion of an SSS Rank Gate cause?<br /><br /><br />

        Bolivia could be wiped off the map.<br /><br /><br />

        And Phase 1? What did that even mean?<br /><br /><br />

        Song-yi was certain she was seeing that term for the first time.<br /><br /><br />

        If it had ended there, she could have dismissed it as just an unusual gate, nothing more.<br /><br /><br />

        But there was a reason she couldn’t.<br /><br /><br />

        [Bonus rewards available upon clear.]<br /><br /><br />

        This message had derailed her.<br /><br /><br />

        The details were as follows:<br /><br /><br />

        [If cleared with 10 or more hours remaining, ‘1 person’ in the world will awaken as a Unique Awakener.<br /><br /><br />

        If cleared with 20 or more hours remaining, ‘2 people’ in the world will awaken as a Unique Awakener.<br /><br /><br />

        If cleared with 30 or more hours remaining, ‘3 people’ in the world will awaken as a Unique Awakener.<br /><br /><br />

        If cleared with 40 or more hours…<br /><br /><br />

        If cleared with 50 or more hours…<br /><br /><br />

        If cleared with 60 or more hours…<br /><br /><br />

        If cleared with 70 or more hours remaining, ‘7 people’ in the world will awaken as a Unique Awakener.]<br /><br /><br />

        “…What in the world is this?”<br /><br /><br />

        This was unprecedented.<br /><br /><br />

        Depending on the clear time, Unique Awakeners would appear in the world?<br /><br /><br />

        It was beyond absurd and unlike any gate she had encountered before.<br /><br /><br />

        And there was more. Another significant difference.<br /><br /><br />

        [Clear Condition: Locate and eliminate Raga of the Three Poisons within the gate.<br /><br /><br />

        Awakeners entering the gate will be provided with a bracelet. Equip the bracelet within 30 seconds. Failure to equip the bracelet will result in immediate death.<br /><br /><br />

        Awakeners who equip the bracelet will receive a blessing.<br /><br /><br />

        This blessing allows you to avoid Raga’s pursuit and will block ‘one’ attack from Raga.<br /><br /><br />

        Upon gate clear, Star #2403 will enter Phase 2.<br /><br /><br />

        Good luck.]<br /><br /><br />

        She reread the message from beginning to end.<br /><br /><br />

        This wasn’t just strange. It was fundamentally different. Unlike any gate before.<br /><br /><br />

        “What’s going on? And what’s with that bracelet?”<br /><br /><br />

        At her brother’s words, Song-yi looked up. A single bracelet was descending from the air.<br /><br /><br />

        She couldn’t ignore the message that told her that she had to equip it within 30 seconds or she would die instantly.<br /><br /><br />

        After securing the bracelet on her wrist, she relayed everything in front of her eyes to her little brother.<br /><br /><br />

        “Phase 1? Time limit? Are they all like this?”<br /><br /><br />

        “Absolutely not. This is a first, even for me. I’m not sure what entering the next phase means. But the biggest problem is…”<br /><br /><br />

        “The part about new Unique Awakeners appearing?”<br /><br /><br />

        “Yeah.”<br /><br /><br />

        “Too bad. We could have taken the credit.”<br /><br /><br />

        If only they weren’t here in secret.<br /><br /><br />

        They would clear it regardless, and as a result, the number of Unique Awakeners in the world would increase.<br /><br /><br />

        But they couldn’t announce it.<br /><br /><br />

        Shi-hu didn’t seem to care, but Song-yi did.<br /><br /><br />

        “Unique Awakeners are special. Whether they want it or not, they possess power far beyond ordinary Awakeners. But will they all turn out to be stable individuals?”<br /><br /><br />

        Shi-hu crossed his arms and listened closely.<br /><br /><br />

        “A Unique Awakener is a valuable asset, one that should be nurtured at the national level. But if their personality is twisted, it becomes a serious problem. More
        importantly…”<br /><br /><br />

        This was the most crucial point.<br /><br /><br />

        “The increase in Unique Awakeners suggests to me that the difficulty of gates will also escalate… Or instead of higher levels, perhaps entirely different kinds of
        gates will emerge…”<br /><br /><br />

        Song-yi’s concern grew, but Shi-hu remained unconcerned.<br /><br /><br />

        He tried to calm her down. “Don’t overthink it. Let’s focus on the task at hand. What’s the point of worrying before we even begin?”<br /><br /><br />

        “…Sorry.”<br /><br /><br />

        However, Song-yi had a point.<br /><br /><br />

        Shi-hu hadn’t been back on Earth long, so he wasn’t invested in gates or related matters.<br /><br /><br />

        However, those who had lived through the changes since the Great Calamity, like Song-yi, had witnessed the world transforming moment by moment.<br /><br /><br />

        Anyone in her position would have reacted similarly.<br /><br /><br />

        But there was also another point of contention.<br /><br /><br />

        “So it was true,” Song-yi commented.<br /><br /><br />

        “What is?”<br /><br /><br />

        “That the gate doesn’t recognize you.”<br /><br /><br />

        No bracelet descended for Shi-hu.<br /><br /><br />

        It intrigued her. Why didn’t the Gate recognize him?<br /><br /><br />

        Was he too strong? Because he was a transcendent?<br /><br /><br />

        Or was it because he was a transcendent of an even higher order?<br /><br /><br />

        There was no way to know yet.<br /><br /><br />

        Only questions remained.<br /><br /><br />

        “Let’s find this Poison Raga or whatever,” Shi-hu said before smirking.<br /><br /><br />

        “Why are you smiling?” Song-yi asked.<br /><br /><br />

        “I just said let’s find it, but I don’t think we need to,” he said while looking up. “I think it’s right there.”<br /><br /><br />

        It was the sky.<br /><br /><br />

        A sky filled with clouds, devoid of sun or anything else.<br /><br /><br />

        “Try shooting your light sphere thingy up there.”<br /><br /><br />

        Song-yi summoned her sphere. Larger and brighter than before, it pulsed with power.<br /><br /><br />

        Before it could unleash its beam towards the sky…<br /><br /><br />

        “Oofta,” Shi-hu said while taking a step back.<br /><br /><br />

        Something fell from the sky.<br /><br /><br />

        KA-BOOOOOOM—!!<br /><br /><br />

        With a deafening blast, Song-yi was thrown back far away.<br /><br /><br />

        * * * I glanced up.<br /><br /><br />

        A hole torn in the sky came into view. And beyond it, I could see an excessively dark, incredibly unpleasant space. Or rather, I sensed it.<br /><br /><br />

        The immediate area was incredibly peaceful. Calm, beautiful, a picturesque scene that soothed the mind.<br /><br /><br />

        It was nothing special, though, because it was all an illusion.<br /><br /><br />

        Judging by the artificial flow of mana, it felt like a barrier, likely one with a calming effect.<br /><br /><br />

        So why was this barrier created?<br /><br /><br />

        “This is rather unpleasant.”<br /><br /><br />

        Powerful beings often disguised their ugly desires with good intentions, and the world beyond those clouds was utterly repulsive.<br /><br /><br />

        Beneath that repulsive world, they crafted this picturesque scenery, casting a spell of tranquility.<br /><br /><br />

        It was only natural that such manipulation would feel unpleasant.<br /><br /><br />

        I subtly drew upon the energy inside my body.<br /><br /><br />

        Rumble.<br /><br /><br />

        With a low vibration, shattered mana fragments cascaded around me.<br /><br /><br />

        My composure returned. I looked up again and took another step back.<br /><br /><br />

        Boom—!!<br /><br /><br />

        A light beam obliterated the spot where I had just been standing.<br /><br /><br />

        I turned my head towards my sister, who had managed to dodge the second attack.<br /><br /><br />

        Standing beside me, she raised her arm, showing the bracelet crumbling away.<br /><br /><br />

        “Relying on trinkets like that will only hinder you,” I told her.<br /><br /><br />

        She immediately responded, “I’ve never once relied on items. I just…”<br /><br /><br />

        “Just what?”<br /><br /><br />

        “…use them when necessary.”<br /><br /><br />

        It was a good mindset.<br /><br /><br />

        “Should I handle this alone? Or do you wanna do it together?” she asked.<br /><br /><br />

        Before that…<br /><br /><br />

        “We need to decide on a clear time. This gate can create Unique Awakeners. How many do you want?”<br /><br /><br />

        My sister answered without hesitation, “Seven.”<br /><br /><br />

        Whether the new Awakeners would be psychopaths, weaklings, or fools was a secondary concern. Ultimately, the more Unique Awakeners, the better.<br /><br /><br />

        Despite everything, my sister cared about the world.<br /><br /><br />

        I glanced at my watch.<br /><br /><br />

        2:23 PM.<br /><br /><br />

        “I’ll give you an hour. Do your best.”<br /><br /><br />

        My sister kicked off from the ground and soared toward the cloud-filled sky.<br /><br /><br />
