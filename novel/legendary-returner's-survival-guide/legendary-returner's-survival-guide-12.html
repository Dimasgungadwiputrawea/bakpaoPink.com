      <h2 class="garis2">Chapter 12</h2>

      <p>
        Jin Song-yi's words were gospel to Youngsu. He trusted her implicitly, which was why he dared to suggest, “Shouldn’t you go after him?”<br /><br /><br />
        However, Song-yi shook her head. “Shi-hu told me that he’s sorry.”<br /><br /><br />
        “……”<br /><br /><br />
        “Next time, I'll be the one apologizing.”<br /><br /><br />
        Youngsu observed her closely. Song-yi looked brighter, as if a tremendous weight had been lifted from her heart.<br /><br /><br />
        It warmed him to see it.<br /><br /><br />
        “You're not planning on going empty-handed, are you, Master Jin?” Youngsu asked with a smile.<br /><br /><br />
        “Of course not! I'm bringing a mountain of gifts.”<br /><br /><br />
        “When are you planning on going?”<br /><br /><br />
        “Hmm… Soon?”<br /><br /><br />
        A thoughtful look crossed Song-yi's face.<br /><br /><br />
        “Youngsu,” she began, her voice hushed. “Could you find me a Translation Magic specialist?”<br /><br /><br />
        “Translation… Magic?”<br /><br /><br />
        “And not just anyone. I need someone highly skilled. Also…”<br /><br /><br />
        Song-yi trailed off, her gaze drifting toward the direction Shi-hu had taken.<br /><br /><br />
        “Thank you,” she finished her sentence.<br /><br /><br />
        “…I didn’t do much. I was mostly hiding like a coward.”<br /><br /><br />
        “Not at all. Just being there was enough.”<br /><br /><br />
        A shared smile passed between them.<br /><br /><br />

        Bin furiously typed onto the search bar with a serious expression on his face.<br /><br /><br />
        [Gas explosion accident in Cheongdam-dong, Seoul]<br /><br /><br />
        [Jin Song-yi, Cheongdam-dong]<br /><br /><br />
        [Jin Song-yi, Jin Shi-hu, Cheongdam-dong]<br /><br /><br />
        [Jin Shi-hu identity]<br /><br /><br />
        [Jin Shi-hu Awakener]<br /><br /><br />
        His brows furrowed.<br /><br /><br />
        Nothing was coming up.<br /><br /><br />
        “What the…? I swear I just saw an article about Song-yi.”<br /><br /><br />
        He knew he hadn't imagined it. He had definitely seen the article, but now it was gone.<br /><br /><br />
        Vanished.<br /><br /><br />
        The official story published was that Song-yi and Shi-hu were caught in a gas explosion, and Shi-hu had been taken to the hospital. That was the headline right now.<br /><br /><br />
        He leaned back, incredulous.<br /><br /><br />
        ‘Was it a dream?’<br /><br /><br />
        His gaze fell to his right hand. As he slowly made a fist, a cracking sound echoed. The unsettling sound of bone grinding against bone filled the room.<br /><br /><br />
        It was hard for Bin to describe it. It was… surprising.<br /><br /><br />
        ‘‘…He claimed to be from Titan, but was he even human?’<br /><br /><br />
        As Bin was lost in contemplation, Shi-hu's parting words echoed in his mind.<br /><br /><br />
        ”It’s your birthday today, isn’t it? Then I need to give you a present.”<br /><br /><br />
        Bin mumbled quietly, “Status Window.”<br /><br /><br />
        A hologram flickered to life before him.<br /><br /><br />

        [Status Window<br /><br /><br />
        Name: Bin<br /><br /><br />
        Class: Ranger<br /><br /><br />
        Level: 80<br /><br /><br />
        Rank: B+<br /><br /><br />
        Potential Rank: ??<br /><br /><br />
        Achievements: 1<br /><br /><br />
        Stats<br /><br /><br />
        Strength: B-<br /><br /><br />
        Dexterity: B+<br /><br /><br />
        Intelligence: B<br /><br /><br />
        Vitality: B+<br /><br /><br />
        Mana (Ki): B<br /><br /><br />
        Stat Points: 0]<br /><br /><br />

        Little had changed. But two things stood out.<br /><br /><br />
        First, the Achievement. He had no clue what it meant, but he could set that aside for now. What bothered him was the ‘Potential Rank’. That was not something he could
        ignore.<br /><br /><br />
        ‘Why did my B Rank Potential Rank become a question mark?’<br /><br /><br />
        As far as Bin knew, only Unique Awakeners had their Potential Rank displayed as such.<br /><br /><br />
        ‘Don't tell me I've become a Unique Awakener.’<br /><br /><br />
        A shiver ran down his spine.<br /><br /><br />
        Knock, knock.<br /><br /><br />
        A sound came from the window, and Bin turned his head.<br /><br /><br />
        “Gah!” Bin shouted.<br /><br /><br />
        He stumbled back, startled—and for good reason. A man with an all-too-familiar face was standing outside his window.<br /><br /><br />
        “Why… Why are you here?”<br /><br /><br />
        “I had nowhere else to go.”<br /><br /><br />
        “…Come again?”<br /><br /><br />
        “It's freezing out here. Let me in.”<br /><br /><br />
        Dumbfounded, Bin walked towards the window.<br /><br /><br />
        ‘The hell kind of nonsense is this?’ he complained in his head.<br /><br /><br />
        It was only when he got to the window that the absurdity of the situation truly struck him.<br /><br /><br />
        ‘This is the 38th floor… But also…’<br /><br /><br />
        “How did you even find me? Did you run a background check on me or something?”<br /><br /><br />
        Shi-hu smirked, “Why bother doing all that? I just followed your scent.”<br /><br /><br />
        “My scent? I swear I showered.”<br /><br /><br />
        “Not that kind of scent. I smelled your Mana. Mana users have a specific Mana scent. Because we spent hours together, I accidentally ended up memorizing yours.”<br /><br /><br />
        “……”<br /><br /><br />
        “So, are you going to let me in or what?”<br /><br /><br />
        Bin had a sinking feeling that if he didn't open up, Shi-hu would simply break in. So, he opened the door.<br /><br /><br />
        Right after opening the window, Bin rushed to his computer and closed his open tabs.<br /><br /><br />
        Shi-hu offered him a smug smile.<br /><br /><br />
        “Seems I interrupted your happy time. Should I wait outside?”<br /><br /><br />
        “…It's not like that.”<br /><br /><br />
        “If you say so. More importantly, how's the birthday present? You like it?”<br /><br /><br />
        ‘Right. The present,’ Bin thought.<br /><br /><br />
        Shi-hu’s present was connected to his Potential Rank turning into a question mark. He was certain of it.<br /><br /><br />
        Shi-hu sat down on the edge of the bed.<br /><br /><br />
        “What exactly did you give me?” Bin asked.<br /><br /><br />
        Shi-hu responded right away, “I simply opened a few of your blocked Mana Circuits.”<br /><br /><br />
        He held up his right index finger and pointed towards Bin.<br /><br /><br />
        “Shoulders, wrists, legs, neck, and head. I opened those eight Mana Circuits in total.”<br /><br /><br />
        “…What?”<br /><br /><br />
        “By Titan standards, most Master-level guys have those open. Consider yourself lucky. I boosted you quite a bit considering you’re only at the 5th Circle.”<br /><br /><br />
        Bin was lost.<br /><br /><br />
        “Circle? Master-level? What are you talking about?”<br /><br /><br />
        “Think of a Circle like a conduit binding the ambient Mana to your body. Each additional Circle allows you to wield more Mana. You said you were a B Rank Awakener,
        right? That roughly translates to the 5th Circle. B Ranks should be capable of reaching the peak of the 5th Circle with enough effort.”<br /><br /><br />
        “……”<br /><br /><br />
        “Speaking of which, I passed by some Awakeners from the Salvation Guild on my way here. It seems A Rank Awakeners have a wider range. There were a variety of both 6th
        and 7th Circle.”<br /><br /><br />
        “What about S Rank?”<br /><br /><br />
        “S Rank was 8th Circle. SS Rank, 9th to 10th Circle. By the way, 10th Circle Mana users are referred to as Master level. I was wondering why the discrepancy was there,
        but I believe it's tied to the level system.”<br /><br /><br />
        Awakeners were categorized by rank, but they were then sub-categorized by their level.<br /><br /><br />
        That level was crucial. Every Awakener always started at Level 1 after their Awakening.<br /><br /><br />
        Take B Rank Awakeners, for example. Once they reached their max level by clearing gates, they were labeled as a ‘B+ Awakener’. Ones that had yet to achieve their max
        level were labeled a ‘B- Awakener’.<br /><br /><br />
        Because an Awakener’s personal information was registered into a database, you could not lie about it.<br /><br /><br />
        Regardless of rank, the levels of each individual Awakener varied greatly—with the exception of those who had hit their level cap.<br /><br /><br />
        It seemed that Circles were a reflection of those Levels.<br /><br /><br />
        Bin tried not to overthink all of that because there was only one thing that truly mattered to him right now.<br /><br /><br />
        “My potential rank is a question mark. Does that mean I'm a Unique Awakener now?”<br /><br /><br />
        Shi-hu's answer was simple.<br /><br /><br />
        “Why are you asking me?”<br /><br /><br />
        “……”<br /><br /><br />
        “I'm not the System. Why? Don't like the gift? I can always take it back.”<br /><br /><br />
        Panic seized Bin.<br /><br /><br />
        “No need to go that far! I'm thankful for the gift. I promise to make good use of it!”<br /><br /><br />
        Chuckling, Shi-hu added, “You seem pretty concerned about system, levels, and ranks, but don’t let it get to you.”<br /><br /><br />
        “…Excuse me?”<br /><br /><br />
        “Why let something like the System dictate your limits? If I were you, I'd be furious. Why are you so accepting of it?”<br /><br /><br />
        Bin was speechless. He hadn't lived a long life, but he had witnessed the world change since the early days of the Great Calamity.<br /><br /><br />
        Without a doubt, Shi-hu's thought process was utterly alien compared to the current residents of Earth.<br /><br /><br />
        “You're staring,” Shi-hu remarked. “I know, I know, I'm devastatingly handsome.”<br /><br /><br />
        “…Okay. I understand what you mean. But why are you here? I told you, I don't want to get mixed up in this anymore.”<br /><br /><br />
        “Life doesn't always go the way you want.”<br /><br /><br />
        Shi-hu snapped his fingers.<br /><br /><br />
        Plink.<br /><br /><br />
        Instantly, Bin's right arm crackled as if struck by lightning and burned. However, it only looked like it was burning.<br /><br /><br />
        Bin looked at his arm in shock. It flickered like a heat haze, but strangely, there was no pain.<br /><br /><br />
        ‘What is this?’ he wondered.<br /><br /><br />
        Shi-hu instructed, “Try and absorb it. I could have filled multiple military training grounds with the number of people willing to gift me a fortune for even a taste
        of that back on Titan.”<br /><br /><br />
        “…Military training grounds? You had those there, too?”<br /><br /><br />
        “Why wouldn’t there have been? I might not look it, but I was a Grand General, you know.”<br /><br /><br />
        Bin stared at his arm, mesmerized. Then, it hit him.<br /><br /><br />
        Ding!<br /><br /><br />

        [You have acquired a Skill.<br /><br /><br />
        Name: Mana Condensation<br /><br /><br />
        Rank: S Rank<br /><br /><br />
        Potential Rank: ?<br /><br /><br />
        Proficiency: 0]<br /><br /><br />

        Right as the notification popped up, Shi-hu grinned.<br /><br /><br />
        “Not bad. To think you’d absorb it instantly.”<br /><br /><br />
        “…Uh… Yeah… I somehow did it…”<br /><br /><br />
        Bin couldn't quite grasp what had just happened. He just absorbed it and gained a skill.<br /><br /><br />
        Was his dormant potential truly that great? That didn’t seem likely to him.<br /><br /><br />
        Shi-hu observed him with a strange expression on his face.<br /><br /><br />
        “That System thing. It seems to have come in handy here.”<br /><br /><br />
        “The System?”<br /><br /><br />
        “It's aiding you. Otherwise, it should be impossible to absorb it so quickly.”<br /><br /><br />
        “Ah… I see.”<br /><br /><br />
        Shi-hu nodded and continued his explanation.<br /><br /><br />
        “Now, listen closely. When you use Mana, be it for Magic or Physical Enhancement, it moves back and forth through the air. Now, when Mana enters your body or manifests
        as Magic through a formula, an ‘empty space' is always created in the process. This empty space both exists and doesn't exist. What do you think would happen if you
        were to continuously force Mana in there?”<br /><br /><br />
        “…It would condense, would it not?”<br /><br /><br />
        “Precisely. And that’s what ‘Ki Manifestation’ is. Compressing Mana can amplify its destructive power. This is the foundation of ‘Maximization’. From creating
        Manifestation to layered Circle Magic, it all stems from this. Pretty simple, right?”<br /><br /><br />
        Bin, who had been listening intently, realized just how valuable Shi-hu's words were.<br /><br /><br />
        No, it was more than just valuable. It was a goldmine of information.<br /><br /><br />
        “This is a way to gather more Mana. Condensation is just the basics. You need to be cognizant of it and really make it yours to be considered a true Master,” explained
        Shi-hu.<br /><br /><br />
        But then, he suddenly went on a side tangent, “But what about my sister? I don’t think anyone taught her. Is she a natural? Is that what makes her a Unique Awakener? I
        wonder… Do you know anything about this?”<br /><br /><br />
        Bin acknowledged the value of the information, but…<br /><br /><br />
        “Why are you speaking to me so familiarly?”<br /><br /><br />
        It was rude in Korean culture to act so casually to strangers, especially when you don’t even know each other's age. So, the abrupt casualness was bothering Bin’s
        Korean sensibilities.<br /><br /><br />
        “Don't be so uptight, man,” Shi-hu said. “We're practically brothers now, aren't we?”<br /><br /><br />
        “…You don't even know how old I am.”<br /><br /><br />
        “Doesn't matter. No matter how old you are, I can guarantee I’m older.”<br /><br /><br />
        “Aren’t you only twenty-eight?”<br /><br /><br />
        Shi-hu's voice softened, “That's simply my physical age. Anyway, little bro.”<br /><br /><br />
        “…Yes?”<br /><br /><br />
        It was time to address the elephant in the room.<br /><br /><br />
        “Let me crash here for a few days.”<br /><br /><br />
