        ◈ Legendary Returner's Survival Guide
      </h2>

      <div class="garis"></div>

      <h2 class="garis2">Chapter 14</h2>

      <p>
        Was there any reason to let him live?<br /><br /><br />
        No. None at all.<br /><br /><br />
        Even if there were, I refused to acknowledge it. To even entertain the possibility…<br /><br /><br />
        The vermin wearing my comrade's face like a stolen mask would die right there.<br /><br /><br />
        My fist clenched, white smoke coiling around it as I saw fear flicker in the bastard's eyes.<br /><br /><br />
        I ignored it.<br /><br /><br />
        My fist slammed down again.<br /><br /><br />
        《White Lotus Sect - Seven Seals of the Holy Flame<br /><br /><br />3rd Technique - Royal Blood Killing Fist》<br /><br /><br />
        KABOOM!!<br /><br /><br />
        A crater gouged the earth, swallowing him.<br /><br /><br />
        Dust billowed, but I could still see it—his face. It was contorted in agony, blood dribbling from his lips.<br /><br /><br />
        I pressed my thumb and middle finger together. Then a flick.<br /><br /><br />
        PLINK—.<br /><br /><br />
        《White Lotus Sect - Seven Seals of the Holy Flame<br /><br /><br />1st Technique - Heaven-Shattering Flick》<br /><br /><br />
        THWACK—!<br /><br /><br />
        Like a bullet, it found its mark, burying itself in the son of a bitch's gut.<br /><br /><br />
        Another choked gasp escaped him, followed by another spray of blood.<br /><br /><br />
        Splatter.<br /><br /><br />
        "What number apostle are you?" I asked as he vomited blood.<br /><br /><br />
        "Wh-who the hell are you…? How do you have this kind of power…?"<br /><br /><br />
        Another flick.<br /><br /><br />
        THUMP—!<br /><br /><br />
        Another burst of blood from his abdomen.<br /><br /><br />
        "You know what the most exhausting thing in the world is?"<br /><br /><br />
        "Kuh… Kegh…"<br /><br /><br />
        "Talking to an idiot. I ask the questions, you answer. We literally established this not even a minute ago. Or do you have a tin can for a brain, my guy?"<br /><br /><br />
        But then something unexpected happened.<br /><br /><br />
        "Haaah… Damn bastard, using out-of-bounds power like that… Unbelievable," the fake Minjae spoke.<br /><br /><br />
        His voice was surprisingly normal.<br /><br /><br />
        I narrowed my eyes. The wounds on his body—they were gone.<br /><br /><br />
        It must be regeneration.<br /><br /><br />
        He pushed himself up. After taking a quick look around, he started clapping loudly.<br /><br /><br />
        《Ancient Sage Arts<br /><br /><br />1st Technique - Spatial Isolation》<br /><br /><br />
        The sight in front of me was changing. Space itself warping and distorting.<br /><br /><br />
        I looked around, my eyes sharp and wary. This was a space within a space, an area on the edge of a dimension.<br /><br /><br />
        He rose to his feet. The crater was still there, but the bystanders who had been watching were gone.<br /><br /><br />
        The shattered, falling remnants of the surroundings were frozen in midair, time seemingly stopping within this strange, isolated place.<br /><br /><br />
        "Cute trick," I said, my voice flat.<br /><br /><br />
        He stretched and cracked his neck, "Didn't expect the original to come back."<br /><br /><br />
        "Neither did I. Honestly, I didn’t think I’d actually make it back."<br /><br /><br />
        "How did you return?"<br /><br /><br />
        "Why should I bother explaining? It’s not like a tin can moron like you would understand."<br /><br /><br />
        "….."<br /><br /><br />
        "Why the long face? I'm only speaking the truth."<br /><br /><br />
        He took a step forward and wings sprouted from his back.<br /><br /><br />
        "I am the 189th Apostle."<br /><br /><br />
        "That’s a big number."<br /><br /><br />
        "An Apostle's number signifies the order of their strength. I’m higher up than the 200th who was impersonating you."<br /><br /><br />
        "It might be higher, but is there much of a difference between 189 and 200? To me, it sounds like you’re comparing who’s got a bigger micropenis. Don’t you think
        you’re acting too cocky?”<br /><br /><br />
        He chuckled, "Here, an Apostle can unleash their full power."<br /><br /><br />
        "Oh, is that right?" I patronized him.<br /><br /><br />
        "The human world can’t handle the true might of an Apostle. In other words, your arrogance ends here."<br /><br /><br />
        I scratched my chin, not quite following. But before I could speak, he leaped forward.<br /><br /><br />
        It caught me by surprise because he was pretty fast.<br /><br /><br />
        All of a sudden, there was a shining sword in his hand. It was no normal weapon. It was one made of pure mana.<br /><br /><br />
        He swung his mana sword just as fast as he had moved.<br /><br /><br />
        The entire exchange took maybe a tenth of a second.<br /><br /><br />
        But that was nothing.<br /><br /><br />
        CRAAASH!!<br /><br /><br />
        My hair whipped around my face as a shockwave rippled through the air. However, I stood there unimpressed, his sword clutched in my right hand.<br /><br /><br />
        He stared at me in shock and disbelief.<br /><br /><br />
        “…H-huh?”<br /><br /><br />
        We stood there, barely a foot apart.<br /><br /><br />
        "You really are an idiot," I teased.<br /><br /><br />
        "What…?"<br /><br /><br />
        "Okay. So you can unleash your full power here. Nice. But why did you think that only applied to you?"<br /><br /><br />
        I clenched my right hand tightly.<br /><br /><br />
        Snap—!<br /><br /><br />
        His mana sword shattered, dissolving into motes of energy.<br /><br /><br />
        I continued, watching the mana fade away, "I’m genuinely curious. Who's pulling your strings?”<br /><br /><br />
        "……"<br /><br /><br />
        “Is it the system?”<br /><br /><br />
        The 189th Apostle didn't answer, but his expression spoke volumes.<br /><br /><br />
        "I must be roughly on the money. Wrecking Earth, tossing two hundred people into another world, replacing them with fakes. What's the endgame?"<br /><br /><br />
        My left hand shot out, clamping around his throat.<br /><br /><br />
        His eyes blazed with light. It was Natural Ki.<br /><br /><br />
        The Ki condensed and shot out as beams.<br /><br /><br />
        "What are you, an X-man?" I quipped.<br /><br /><br />
        There was a reason I was able to act so casually. It was because the beams had dissipated harmlessly as they touched me.<br /><br /><br />
        I was using a technique called 《Ki Armor》, created by enveloping my body with Mana. Natural Ki was supposed to be an energy superior to mana, yet it couldn't even
        scratch me. The difference in our power was that vast.<br /><br /><br />
        He thrashed, realizing his predicament, but it was no use. I wasn't letting go.<br /><br /><br />
        "I asked you a question. What's the endgame?"<br /><br /><br />
        "Like I'd ever tell you."<br /><br /><br />
        "It beats dying, doesn't it?"<br /><br /><br />
        "Those are sweet words, but that look in your eyes… it tells me that you're gonna kill me either way."<br /><br /><br />
        I laughed.<br /><br /><br />
        "Color me surprised. You’re sharper than you look. And here I thought you were duller than a spoon."<br /><br /><br />
        "……"<br /><br /><br />
        “Honestly, I don’t actually care that much. Whatever your goals are, I can just kill you all.”<br /><br /><br />
        “……”<br /><br /><br />
        “What if I tortured you? Will you talk then?”<br /><br /><br />
        “Never. And there’s no point in trying. I’m Oath Bound.”<br /><br /><br />
        I shrugged. It was whatever.<br /><br /><br />
        “That’s a shame. I was seriously contemplating torture.”<br /><br /><br />
        “…What?”<br /><br /><br />
        “But it’s kind of hard to bring myself to torture you when you have a familiar face.”<br /><br /><br />
        “……”<br /><br /><br />
        I had wasted too much time.<br /><br /><br />

        Now, I'm going to punch you exactly one time. Survive, and I’ll let you live. Deal?<br /><br /><br />
        He stared at me with skepticism, but I meant it. I always keep my word.<br /><br /><br />
        Now, show me all you got," I warned him as I drew back my right fist.<br /><br /><br />
        Fwooosh.<br /><br /><br />
        White smoke engulfed it, almost giving it the appearance of white flames.<br /><br /><br />
        As the space he created distorted, his eyes widened in terror. That was the only reaction he was able to give.<br /><br /><br />
        My fist shot forward in a straight line.<br /><br /><br />
        《White Lotus Sect - Seven Seals of the Holy Flame<br /><br /><br />3rd Technique Variant - Heavenly Blood and Spirit Killing Fist》<br /><br /><br />
        C-C-CRAAACK!<br /><br /><br />
        Space itself tore apart as my fist connected with his face.<br /><br /><br />
        His head exploded without a trace. There was no flesh, bones, or blood. None of that.<br /><br /><br />
        It was simply pulverized out of existence.<br /><br /><br />
        Apparently, his head was not just empty like a tin can, but it was also only as strong as one, too.<br /><br /><br />
        The pocket dimension shuddered violently. Spells extinguished when their caster died—an ironclad rule of magic.<br /><br /><br />
        There were no exceptions unless the caster had prepared a contingency beforehand. However, any mechanism that enabled such a thing was always easy to spot.<br /><br /><br />
        He was gone, and so was his spell.<br /><br /><br />
        And so I returned to the real world, standing over the 189th Apostle, his body returned to his ‘human’ form.<br /><br /><br />

        Episode 4<br /><br /><br />

        "It's too detailed to be fiction, yet too fantastical to be autobiographical," the man sitting across from Song-yi said.<br /><br /><br />

        The man’s name was Stuart Mill, and he was an American Awakener. Though he was S Rank, he wasn't the kind of Awakener who cleared gates or slayed monsters.<br /><br /><br />

        Before Awakening, he was a renowned linguist at the University of Pennsylvania. Now, he specialized in deciphering and analyzing the languages and scripts of various
        ‘civilizations’ that appeared within gates.<br /><br /><br />

        He possessed no combat skills whatsoever, but he had the «Translate» skill—an SS Rank one, at that.<br /><br /><br />

        Stuart was the only one on Earth who had managed to elevate the «Translate» skill to such a high level, yet even he was baffled.<br /><br /><br />

        "It's fascinating. The language here bears striking similarities to Earth’s English and Hanja. This Titan Continent… or, more precisely, this Titan planet, it's like
        something out of a fantasy novel."<br /><br /><br />

        "Are you sure?"<br /><br /><br />

        "Indeed. It’s a world with dragons, orcs, goblins, and all sorts of other mythical creatures. A world that has both Magic and Martial Arts—a blend of Eastern and
        Western fantasy tropes. This document is a chronicle of that world. The question is…"<br /><br /><br />

        He hesitated, his expression a mixture of scholarly curiosity and deep concern.<br /><br /><br />

        "Is all of this indeed true?"<br /><br /><br />

        "……" Song-yi remained silent.<br /><br /><br />

        "Not once has a place called Titan appeared before. Gates have primarily had civilizations from Earth's past, like ancient Egypt. Though rare, we have seen places like
        the 'Yoron Continent' and the 'Meiza Continent.' The golems we encounter in A Rank gates, for instance, originate from Meiza. The world truly is a vast and mysterious
        place. Perhaps this is just the tip of the iceberg. Of course, this is just my speculation."<br /><br /><br />

        Stuart was a scholar, prone to hypothesizing and theorizing. Observation, deduction, the pursuit of truth—it was in his nature.<br /><br /><br />

        But one thing was certain.<br /><br /><br />

        The translation was complete.<br /><br /><br />

        "Do you see these markings and letters at the front?”<br /><br /><br />

        Stuart pointed to them one by one. They were [200 Special Monsters], [Golden Lion Mercenary Corps], [White Lotus Sect], and [Holy Empire].<br /><br /><br />

        With the exception of ‘200 Special Monsters’, emblems that resembled a stamp adorned the document next to each phrase.<br /><br /><br />

        “Normally, recordings in gates—such as headstones—have a faint feel of ‘Mana’. Miss Song-yi, I’m sure you are familiar with it, but the Mana within a gate and Mana on
        earth are different.”<br /><br /><br />

        “If you are talking about how, despite both being Mana, they have a different thickness among other factors, then yes, I am aware.”<br /><br /><br />

        "These symbols… They have the scent of Mana. It’s an intense scent, the kind you'd only find on ancient documents. However, I’ve never seen such a Mana scent on Earth,
        despite having inspected thousands of gates.”<br /><br /><br />

        "……"<br /><br /><br />

        "As I said, this reads more like an autobiography than fiction. Outlandish as it seems, the world it describes might actually exist. But this 'Jin Shi-hu'… is he, by
        any chance…"<br /><br /><br />

        He struggled to find the right words, but the question had to be asked.<br /><br /><br />

        "Your younger brother?"<br /><br /><br />

        Song-yi wasn’t particularly trying to hide it. Stuart wasn’t just some nobody. He was a world-class linguist. However, she also had no intention of freely blabbering
        about it. So, she answered the question by pleading the fifth.<br /><br /><br />

        Song-yi smiled faintly, "Thank you, Professor. Your expertise has been invaluable."<br /><br /><br />

        Stuart didn’t want to press further. He had agreed to a «Pledge of Silence» before accepting the job. It was a magical contract that ensured absolute secrecy. Any
        breach, direct or indirect, would alert Song-yi, and she would have the power to end his life with a thought.<br /><br /><br />

        Despite the pledge, she had chosen not to confirm that the one in the document was her young brother Jin Shi-hu.<br /><br /><br />

        He chose not to be offended.<br /><br /><br />

        Rising from his seat with a smile, he said, "I heard you’re leaving for the United States today. Does that mean we will be departing together, then?"<br /><br /><br />

        "Yes. That's correct."<br /><br /><br />

        "I'll be downstairs having coffee. Take your time."<br /><br /><br />

        "Thank you. I'll be down shortly."<br /><br /><br />
