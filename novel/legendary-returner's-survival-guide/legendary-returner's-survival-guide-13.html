        ◈ Legendary Returner's Survival Guide
      </h2>

      <div class="garis"></div>

      <h2 class="garis2">Chapter 13</h2>

      <p>
        “Good morning, Captain.”<br /><br /><br />
        Ji Changsu stared blankly at the new recruit's cheerful greeting.<br /><br /><br />
        “Are you alright, sir? Are you feeling unwell?” Bin asked.<br /><br /><br />
        “…Uh… no, I’m fine.”<br /><br /><br />
        Yesterday had been a disaster. Not only had the Gate Detection Device, which had a near-perfect accuracy rate, malfunctioned multiple times, but the new recruit, Bin,
        had nearly been swept into a suddenly appearing gate—on his birthday, no less.<br /><br /><br />
        Changsu was a pretty reasonable man.<br /><br /><br />
        It was his fault, really. He was preparing a surprise party at the end of the day for the team to celebrate Bin's birthday. That was the reason he had sent Bin out
        alone, but that could not justify what happened.<br /><br /><br />
        Sending a rookie out alone… That was the root of the problem.<br /><br /><br />
        It had been a day of near misses and apologies. Changsu had felt so guilty that he had even let Bin off work early.<br /><br /><br />
        But today, Bin’s expression was not what he expected.<br /><br /><br />
        He didn’t seem troubled at all. In fact, he was too damn cheerful.<br /><br /><br />
        “Hey, newbie.”<br /><br /><br />
        There was only one person in the Gate Safety Management Team who warranted such a title.<br /><br /><br />
        Bin turned around and asked, “Yes, Captain? Would you like some coffee?”<br /><br /><br />
        “No, I can make my own. Are you sure you're okay?”<br /><br /><br />
        Bin smiled softly and replied, “Yes, I'm fine. Things like yesterday happen sometimes.”<br /><br /><br />
        No, an event like yesterday was not supposed to happen.<br /><br /><br />
        But for Bin, yesterday's events were a blessing in disguise.<br /><br /><br />
        He still wanted nothing to do with matters between Shi-hu and Song-yi, that much was clear.<br /><br /><br />
        However, he and Shi-hu had now become brotherly, not to mention the fact that Shi-hu had saved his life.<br /><br /><br />
        On top of being a literal lifesaver, Shi-hu had bestowed an incredible gift upon him.<br /><br /><br />
        Even if he didn't want to get involved, he could at least offer some help. Or, rather, Bin wanted to help Shi-hu if possible. He owed him that much.<br /><br /><br />
        Bin noticed Changsu's vacant expression. He remembered that he was in the middle of a conversation.<br /><br /><br />
        “As for the gate incident, it was my fault for being careless,” Bin continued, his smile unwavering. “I'm just glad it all ended well. Thank you for your concern,
        Captain.”<br /><br /><br />
        “…Ah… Alright. I'm glad you think so… Ehem… What was I about to do again?”<br /><br /><br />
        As if on cue, Bin handed Changsu the materials for the morning meeting.<br /><br /><br />
        “Th-thanks.”<br /><br /><br />
        “You're welcome, sir. I'll prep the meeting right away.”<br /><br /><br />
        People didn’t change easily. So, if they appeared to, it was either a mask falling away and revealing their true selves, or they were simply acting like they had
        changed.<br /><br /><br />
        Bin was the former. He was more lax, exuding a newfound hope.<br /><br /><br />
        Ever since becoming an Awakener, money and political power had lost their appeal to him.<br /><br /><br />
        What Bin wanted most was strength. To become stronger, to kill more monsters, to give the world true freedom.<br /><br /><br />
        This wasn't unique to him; many Awakeners felt the same. The difference was that Bin now had hope that he could genuinely become stronger. That was why he seemed so
        different.<br /><br /><br />
        He recalled his conversation with Shi-hu, the one who gave him that newfound hope, that morning.<br /><br /><br />
        “When do you get off work?” Shi-hu had asked.<br /><br /><br />
        “As long as nothing comes up, I get off at 6 p.m.”<br /><br /><br />
        “Really? Then pick up some fried chicken on your way back. And leave about $100 on the desk over there.”<br /><br /><br />
        Anyone who didn't know the situation would have thought Shi-hu was some kind of thug, but $100 was nothing to fret over. He would happily give him $1000 if Shi-hu
        wanted it.<br /><br /><br />
        “Are you going somewhere?”<br /><br /><br />
        “Yeah.”<br /><br /><br />
        “Where?”<br /><br /><br />
        “It’s a secret.”<br /><br /><br />
        “……”<br /><br /><br />
        “Good luck at work.”<br /><br /><br />
        And so, Bin left for work after placing the money on the desk as instructed.<br /><br /><br />
        A thought struck him.<br /><br /><br />
        What was Shi-hu doing right now?<br /><br /><br />

        Gyeongbuk Dreamvalley.<br /><br /><br />

        A district in Gimcheon City, North Gyeongsang Province, it was also known as “North Gyeongsang Gimcheon Innovation City”.<br /><br /><br />

        Its high-speed rail station was eerily deserted.<br /><br /><br />

        It was a while back that it happened. An S Rank gate had erupted from the Yulgok-dong Community Center, a neighborhood within Dreamvalley. The gate devastated a radius
        of several kilometers, forcing the few existing residents to flee to the Gate Safe Zone.<br /><br /><br />

        Shi-hu surveyed the area.<br /><br /><br />

        “Hmm. He’s not here.”<br /><br /><br />

        He took a small device from his pocket. A smartphone, a relic from the bygone era that had been replaced in the age of watches.<br /><br /><br />

        It was an iPhone 15 Pro from the year 2024.<br /><br /><br />

        Shi-hu opened the messenger app.<br /><br /><br />

        There was only one chat window with the most recent message from an hour ago.<br /><br /><br />

        He tapped on it.<br /><br /><br />

        [Kim Minjae Real Estate: This place is amazing. It's sunny, the security is top-notch, and the rent is cheap. The monthly rent is only $300, an impossible deal in this
        day and age. If you come now, I'll talk to the landlord and try to get the deposit lowered.]<br /><br /><br />

        [Me: I'm on the train now. I'll contact you when I arrive.]<br /><br /><br />

        [Kim Minjae Real Estate: Then I'll come pick you up.]<br /><br /><br />

        [Kim Minjae Real Estate: Where are you now?]<br /><br /><br />

        [Me: I passed Cheonan 10 minutes ago.]<br /><br /><br />

        [Kim Minjae Real Estate: If you're past Cheonan, you'll be here soon. I'll head out now.]<br /><br /><br />

        Shi-hu called the real estate agent.<br /><br /><br />

        After five rings, he answered, “Hello?”<br /><br /><br />

        “I’m the person who wanted to see the room today. I just arrived. Where are you?”<br /><br /><br />

        “Ah, Mr. Jeong Bin? You're here already? Sorry, my bad. Something came up, and I couldn't come to pick you up.”<br /><br /><br />

        Shi-hu smiled faintly at his casual mix of informal and formal speech.<br /><br /><br />

        ”You know the address, right? Just take a taxi. I'll get the fare,” the agent told him.<br /><br /><br />

        There was a reason why the agent was acting like that.<br /><br /><br />

        It was Gimcheon, a city an hour away from Seoul. Going back because of a little bit of a bad attitude would be a colossal waste of time.<br /><br /><br />

        Minjae was acting like he had the upper hand. He was living up to his reputation as the real estate agent with the lowest online rating.<br /><br /><br />

        Shi-hu hung up without a word and hailed a taxi.<br /><br /><br />

        The ride took only five minutes. The office was located in a small shopping district.<br /><br /><br />

        Shi-hu spotted the sign that read ‘Kim Minjae Real Estate’ on a small building and walked towards it.<br /><br /><br />

        He could see Kim Minjae through the window, watching TV with his feet up on the sofa. Seeing his laughing face caused conflicting feelings for Shi-hu.<br /><br /><br />

        Kim Minjae.<br /><br /><br />

        He was Shi-hu’s comrade on the Titan Continent, a comrade who had died about two years ago.<br /><br /><br />

        Shi-hu could still vividly remember his death.<br /><br /><br />

        “Ah… life fucking blows. Hey, Shi-hu.”<br /><br /><br />

        “Yeah, big bro.”<br /><br /><br />

        “You have to make it back to Earth alive. But before you go, make sure to fillet all those lizard bastards. You're the only one who can do it.”<br /><br /><br />

        “You could have done it too, big bro. You can’t kick the bucket here. What am I supposed to do? Don’t be a premature ejector.”<br /><br /><br />

        “You little bitch… You always think you’re so clever. Hey, remember the favor I asked you for before?”<br /><br /><br />

        “Of course.”<br /><br /><br />

        “I trust you. My grandmother is in very poor health. She's probably still going through hell looking for me. If you somehow manage to go back, I hope I can leave it up
        to you. Okay?”<br /><br /><br />

        Shi-hu had held onto the dying man's hand, “Have you ever seen me break a promise?”<br /><br /><br />

        “Never.”<br /><br /><br />

        “Then that's settled. I promise to take good care of your grandmother when I get back to Earth.”<br /><br /><br />

        “If… Just in case…”<br /><br /><br />

        Shi-hu had shaken his head. He knew what the man was trying to say.<br /><br /><br />

        “…I need to say it. If she's passed away… Please hold a memorial service for her in my place. Just once, that's all I ask.”<br /><br /><br />

        “I'll do it twice.”<br /><br /><br />

        “You rascal… I take back what I said about you being cold-hearted before. Take care. Sorry I’m going first.”<br /><br /><br />

        “Yeah, big bro. Thank you for everything. Please rest in peace.”<br /><br /><br />

        Kim Minjae was a warrior.<br /><br /><br />

        Shi-hu was the Grand General of the Titan Continent’s Holy Empire, and MinJae was the 1st Commander of the Holy Empire Infantry. He was a great commander among
        commanders, leading tens of thousands of soldiers in the war against Dragons.<br /><br /><br />

        He had been thirty-two years old in 2024, working as a real estate agent on Earth before falling into Titan.<br /><br /><br />

        Now, the Kim Minjae beyond the window, watching TV and laughing, was a fake. The real Kim Minjae, the one Shi-hu knew, was dead.<br /><br /><br />

        Shi-hu was there to keep his promise. That was all.<br /><br /><br />

        As he opened the door and went inside, Minjae looked up from the TV in surprise.<br /><br /><br />

        “What the…? Why are you here?”<br /><br /><br />

        “……”<br /><br /><br />

        “You’re supposed to be in Seoul. So I ask again, why are you here?”<br /><br /><br />

        Shi-hu silently took out his smartphone.<br /><br /><br />

        Kim Minjae tilted his head in confusion, “What's with that antique?”<br /><br /><br />

        As Shi-hu pressed the call button, Minjae's watch vibrated. He glanced at it and burst into laughter, as if he couldn't believe it.<br /><br /><br />

        “What the hell? Since when did you start using two names? Did you go nuts? What about Jin Song-yi? Isn't it your job to keep an eye on the Unique Awakener…”<br /><br /><br />

        Shi-hu didn't bother listening. He turned and walked towards the door, locking it.<br /><br /><br />

        Then, after flipping the ‘OPEN’ sign to ‘CLOSE,’ he walked back to Minjae and sat down in front of him.<br /><br /><br />

        “What’s your deal? Why are you barging into my business and…? Wait a minute.”<br /><br /><br />

        Kim Minjae's brow furrowed. He must have noticed something strange.<br /><br /><br />

        “You… Are you really Jin Shi-hu?” Minjae asked.<br /><br /><br />

        Shi-hu didn’t answer. Instead, he snapped back, “Let's set some ground rules.”<br /><br /><br />

        “…Rules?”<br /><br /><br />

        “I ask the questions, you answer them. Nod if you understand.”<br /><br /><br />

        “…The fuck? Are you high or something?”<br /><br /><br />

        Again, Shi-hu ignored his question.<br /><br /><br />

        “Your grandmother. I believe her name was Hong Seung-hee, right? Where is she now?”<br /><br /><br />

        “Where else would she be? She's in heaven. Why are you being a moron and asking the obvious?”<br /><br /><br />

        Shi-hu closed his eyes for a moment and let out a quiet sigh.<br /><br /><br />

        The worst possible answer. The one he didn't want to hear the most.<br /><br /><br />

        He slowly opened his eyes. A faint murderous aura emanated from him.<br /><br /><br />

        Minjae stared blankly at Shi-hu.<br /><br /><br />

        “When did she pass away?” Shi-hu asked.<br /><br /><br />

        “……”<br /><br /><br />

        “Did you take good care of her until the very end?”<br /><br /><br />

        “……”<br /><br /><br />

        “Did you at least share one meal with her before she passed?”<br /><br /><br />

        A smug smirk spread across Minjae's face.<br /><br /><br />

        “What drugs are you on? Are you for real? Why are you acting like you don’t know?”<br /><br /><br />

        “I don't know. That's why I'm asking.”<br /><br /><br />

        “You’re being real curt.”<br /><br /><br />

        “Just answer the question.”<br /><br /><br />

        Minjae gave the one answer Shi-hu had hoped wasn't true.<br /><br /><br />

        “I killed her as soon as I arrived on Earth.”<br /><br /><br />

        “……”<br /><br /><br />

        “Didn't I tell you about it over the phone? The look on that old hag's face when she died at the hands of her own grandson? What's gotten into you today? Did I do
        something to upset you?”<br /><br /><br />

        He had killed her.<br /><br /><br />

        As said earlier, it was one of the worst possible answers Shi-hu could have imagined.<br /><br /><br />

        That was enough. No, it was more than enough.<br /><br /><br />

        Fwoosh!<br /><br /><br />

        White smoke billowed from Shi-hu's body.<br /><br /><br />

        As Minjae's eyes widened in shock at the sight of White Lotus Ki being utilized to the extreme, Shi-hu reached out and grabbed him by the hair.<br /><br /><br />

        “You’re going to pay for that.”<br /><br /><br />

        Shi-hu's fist flew into Minjae's face.<br /><br /><br />

        CRAAASH—!!<br /><br /><br />

        The building collapsed.<br /><br /><br />

        * * *<br /><br /><br />

        200 people.<br /><br /><br />

        It was a large number, but in the right context, one could also say it was a small number.<br /><br /><br />

        Not all 200 people were personally acquainted with each other, and it wasn't like all 199 of them had asked me for a favor.<br /><br /><br />

        How do I explain it?<br /><br /><br />

        It might be a bit of bragging, but it was also true. All 200, including myself, possessed extraordinary talents.<br /><br /><br />

        Even the least talented among them had reached the ‘Grand Master’ level in Titan, a level above Master.<br /><br /><br />

        As we were monstrous people from another world, the inhabitants of the Titan Continent called us the ‘200 Special Monsters.’<br /><br /><br />

        Some became citizens of the Holy Empire, some sought refuge with the Beastmen, some became Dungeon Masters, and some even became kings.<br /><br /><br />

        Some became enemies and others allies.<br /><br /><br />

        We 200 were friends, comrades, and enemies.<br /><br /><br />

        Kim Minjae was my comrade, one of the people I could trust to have my back.<br /><br /><br />

        And yet, that bastard bragged about killing Minjae’s grandmother like it was some kind of trophy.<br /><br /><br />

        Would there be any reason to let him live?<br /><br /><br />

        I reached out and grabbed Minjae by the throat.<br /><br /><br />

        Squeeze.<br /><br /><br />

        Without a word, I tightened my grip.<br /><br /><br />
