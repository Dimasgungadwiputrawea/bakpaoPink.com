        ◈ Legendary Returner's Survival Guide
      </h2>

      <div class="garis"></div>

      <h2 class="garis2">Chapter 11</h2>

      <p>
        The intensity of the moment was palpable. My sister sat on the bed, her gaze piercing me while countless others watched from outside.<br /><br /><br />
        “You'll wear a hole through me with that stare,” I told her.<br /><br /><br />
        I looked her up and down. She was the sister etched in my memories, yet there were subtle differences.<br /><br /><br />
        Perhaps it was the weight of the trials and tribulations she had faced.<br /><br /><br />
        I smiled softly at her and asked, “Since when did you become so paranoid?”<br /><br /><br />
        Rising slowly, I walked around the room, fingers trailing across the desk. There was not a single speck of dust.<br /><br /><br />
        “You must have regularly cleaned this place, right?”<br /><br /><br />
        “Yes.”<br /><br /><br />
        I continued to pace around the room.<br /><br /><br />
        The window was incredibly small. Not just the window, but the entire shabby room was unfit for such a grand house.<br /><br /><br />
        The room, the window, the furniture—the details on them were too precise, a testament to the vividness of her memories.<br /><br /><br />
        “You must not have trusted that 200th Apostle guy.”<br /><br /><br />
        “At first, I did. But as time passed, something felt off.”<br /><br /><br />
        “What felt off?”<br /><br /><br />
        “His actions, his mannerisms…”<br /><br /><br />
        I kept my gaze on her, prompting her to continue.<br /><br /><br />
        “It was like he was acting.”<br /><br /><br />
        “Acting?”<br /><br /><br />
        “It was like he was playing a role. A character who was supposed to be a non-awakener who churned out sub-par novels despite being the brother of Jin Song-yi, Korea's
        most celebrated Awakener. But the details, the nuances, they were all wrong. His expressions didn't match his emotions, and his reactions were unnatural, not something
        an ordinary person would do.”<br /><br /><br />
        I listened closely in silence.<br /><br /><br />
        “People don't change easily. The you I knew, the you from the past, wasn't like that. You were free-spirited and responsible.”<br /><br /><br />
        “Me?”<br /><br /><br />
        “Yes, you. At least, that's how you seemed to me. You understood what you had to do, what you didn't have to do, and what you should never do. And you stuck to those
        principles. Looking back, you matured too fast. And…”<br /><br /><br />
        I wondered what she was going to say next.<br /><br /><br />
        “It was August 16, 2024. I still remember how you had told me you were going to the Cheongju Outlet Mall. You claim to have gone missing that day, but in my memory,
        you were taken away by an ambulance. I was told you had collapsed at a crosswalk.”<br /><br /><br />
        Apparently, that was when I was swapped.<br /><br /><br />
        My sister asked me again, “Are you really Shi-hu?”<br /><br /><br />
        “How many times do I have to tell you? Yes, it's me.”<br /><br /><br />
        “…Where were you all this time? And what about that power? Honestly, none of this makes sense to me. I'm so confused.”<br /><br /><br />
        Leaning back against the wall, I sighed. “It's a long story, but would you like to hear it?”<br /><br /><br />
        She nodded, and I began to speak in a low voice.<br /><br /><br />
        I told her about arriving in another world. The kind people who offered me food despite the language barrier. The countless monsters that roamed that world.<br /><br /><br />
        And then I told her about the two hundred people who had fallen into Titan with me, about our struggle for survival, about how they had died.<br /><br /><br />
        I condensed everything as much as possible. It wasn't a story you could tell in one sitting. It would take days, weeks even, to fully recount the horrors I'd
        witnessed. So, I tried to keep it short and quick.<br /><br /><br />
        At first, she seemed unsure, but as I continued, she became engrossed in my story. Finally, she nodded, seemingly convinced.<br /><br /><br />
        Her look of acceptance, however, brought me no solace. I couldn't muster any expression.<br /><br /><br />
        “You really are my little brother.”<br /><br /><br />
        I was truly unable to react.<br /><br /><br />
        “Shi-hu, you've been through so much. You've… you've really been through so much.”<br /><br /><br />
        She embraced me, her hand stroking my back.<br /><br /><br />
        But throughout it all, I remained expressionless… Because I knew her words and actions weren't genuine.<br /><br /><br />
        Unable to speak, I gently pushed her away and sighed.<br /><br /><br />
        I wasn't good at convincing people, which is why I usually resolved things with my fists. That was how I had lived.<br /><br /><br />
        Because of that, the situation was proving to be incredibly difficult.<br /><br /><br />
        “Shi-hu, what’s wrong?”<br /><br /><br />
        I remained silent at my sister’s question.<br /><br /><br />
        Honestly, I had hoped for a more emotional reunion, one where she would immediately recognize me and burst into tears. It was a foolish hope.<br /><br /><br />
        Life rarely goes according to plan, and if life itself was unpredictable, the human heart was even more so.<br /><br /><br />
        “What did you feel earlier?” I asked her.<br /><br /><br />
        “Earlier? When?”<br /><br /><br />
        “Before you blacked out.”<br /><br /><br />
        “…Like I was going to die.”<br /><br /><br />
        She was right. If I hadn't stopped my fist, she would have died. That meant one thing: the power gap between us was insurmountable.<br /><br /><br />
        She was putting on an act.<br /><br /><br />
        “Are you worried?”<br /><br /><br />
        “Worried about what?”<br /><br /><br />
        “The people outside. Are you worried about them?”<br /><br /><br />
        “……”<br /><br /><br />
        “You’re scared that I'll kill them all, that I'll kill you, too. Am I wrong? You're acting like you believe I'm your brother, but deep down, you’re not certain. That's
        why you're behaving like this.”<br /><br /><br />
        She didn't answer.<br /><br /><br />
        “Maybe this is my fault. I thought I was holding back, but I guess I still went a little overboard.”<br /><br /><br />
        This was reality. Her brother, who had gone missing for ten years, had returned to a changed world, wielding inhuman power. How could she possibly believe it?<br /><br /><br />
        In the end, the problem was power. The overwhelming power I possessed had become an obstacle.<br /><br /><br />
        As much as I hated to admit it, I also had to accept the reality of it. Her reaction was completely natural and understandable.<br /><br /><br />
        “I don't think today is the day,” I told her.<br /><br /><br />
        If one longed and yearned for someone for enough time, a person could become like my sister. If I were in her shoes, I would probably be acting the same way.<br /><br /><br />
        I reached my hand out into thin air.<br /><br /><br />
        With a crackle, space distorted, and my hand disappeared into the void. From the void, I slowly pulled out a book.<br /><br /><br />
        “If there’s any translation magic, you should learn it. This book is a record of most of my experiences on Titan over the past ten years. You should be able to read it
        once you learn some translation magic.”<br /><br /><br />
        I placed the book on the desk.<br /><br /><br />
        The room felt different now, as if time, frozen for a decade, had finally started moving again. Sentimentally, of course.<br /><br /><br />
        “This thing is very important and precious to me. Like, really precious. Please don't damage it or lose it. And I'd prefer it if others didn't touch it carelessly
        either.”<br /><br /><br />
        I walked towards the front door before turning my head back.<br /><br /><br />
        “I'll come back when you've sorted out your feelings, sis.”<br /><br /><br />
        I stepped outside.<br /><br /><br />
        The night air was refreshing. At the same time, hundreds of gazes fell upon me.<br /><br /><br />
        I couldn’t help but laugh.<br /><br /><br />
        Standing before me was Chief Secretary Yoon Youngsu.<br /><br /><br />
        I walked towards him.<br /><br /><br />
        “I thought my sister ordered you to withdraw, but I see that you didn't listen.”<br /><br /><br />
        “…What did you do to Master Jin?”<br /><br /><br />
        “Who knows? But what if I did do something?”<br /><br /><br />
        Youngsu tightened his grip on his sword, “I would attack you. Even if it means risking my life, I’d figure out a way to attack you.”<br /><br /><br />
        I was right about him. He was a loyal man, willing to throw away his life for the one he served. Such people possessed unwavering faith in their judgment and an
        unquestioning spirit.<br /><br /><br />
        I smiled gently, “Nothing happened, and nothing will happen. By the way…”<br /><br /><br />
        “……”<br /><br /><br />
        “I personally like you. You're competent, perceptive, and most importantly, I can feel the sincerity in your heart when it comes to my sister.”<br /><br /><br />
        I reached out and placed my hand on Youngsu's shoulder.<br /><br /><br />
        He flinched. I could sense that he tried to dodge my hand, but it was futile. No one could evade my hand.<br /><br /><br />
        “Please continue to take care of my sister. If something happens that you can't handle, or if her life is in danger, call me. I'll be there in a heartbeat.”<br /><br /><br />
        Youngsu asked the critical question, “You probably don’t have a phone. How am I supposed to call you?”<br /><br /><br />
        “Ah, right. Hmm… I do know someone who could help me. Do you know Jeong Bin from the Cheongju Gate Safety Management Team?”<br /><br /><br />
        “…I do not.”<br /><br /><br />
        “Well, you can find out within a day, right?”<br /><br /><br />
        “It won't even take a day. Five minutes is enough.”<br /><br /><br />
        “I'll be with him, so contact me later when you have a chance.”<br /><br /><br />
        I turned and walked away.<br /><br /><br />
        The night air was chilly.<br /><br /><br />
        Not everything had gone according to plan, but I was satisfied. Time would heal all wounds, and I needed time to adjust to Earth.<br /><br /><br />
        There were a few eyes that followed me, but I brushed it off, offering a gentle smile in return.<br /><br /><br />
        The people who met my gaze flinched. They seemed to be thinking, ‘What’s up with him? He seems different.’<br /><br /><br />
        I paid them no mind.<br /><br /><br />
        It had been a long day.<br /><br /><br />

        “You really don't listen to me, do you, Chief Secretary?”<br /><br /><br />
        Youngsu turned towards the voice.<br /><br /><br />
        Song-yi was standing with an awkward smile on her face. It seemed nothing serious had transpired inside.<br /><br /><br />
        “I apologize, ma’am,” Yoon Youngsu responded instinctively.<br /><br /><br />
        “No, it's fine. I understand how you feel. I can't fault you for that.”<br /><br /><br />
        Looking past Youngsu, Song-yi watched as Shi-hu walked away.<br /><br /><br />
        “I always dreamed of this, of my brother returning, always waiting for it. But it's strange, isn't it?”<br /><br /><br />
        “It's not strange at all. Anyone would have reacted the same way.”<br /><br /><br />
        Song-yi shook her head. “How should I put it? I'm still confused. The 200th Apostle… to think he was impersonating my brother all this time.”<br /><br /><br />
        “I'm just as shocked. Honestly, unlike you, Master Jin, I never sensed anything off about him.”<br /><br /><br />
        Of course, Youngsu didn’t know what Shi-hu was like as a child. They had never met when he was younger. Instead, the dissonance he was referring to was his ‘power’.<br /><br /><br />
        Not the power of the real Jin Shi-hu but of the 200th Apostle, the imposter.<br /><br /><br />
        Having spectated the whole ordeal, the fake Shi-hu’s power was on par with Song-yi, or maybe even greater.<br /><br /><br />
        ‘He concealed such immense power and pretended to be a normal civilian? For ten whole years?’ thought Youngsu. He tried to maintain a calm facade, but his mind was in
        turmoil.<br /><br /><br />
        He had been living while believing that the gates were the enemy, but it turned out that a far greater threat had existed all along.<br /><br /><br />
        Song-yi broke the silence, “Ten years. That’s a long time. To tell you the truth, there have been many times I thought something about my brother was off during that
        time. I questioned whether or not he really was my brother. The nagging feeling made me even go as far as to do multiple blood tests in secret, but the results were
        always a positive match.”<br /><br /><br />
        Youngsu silently watched Song-yi.<br /><br /><br />
        “But every time the test result would say that he was indeed my little brother, my instincts would tell me that he was not. That something wasn’t right. But I couldn’t
        tell anyone. How could I when I was acting crazy, questioning the result of an untampered test? But turns out that my instincts were right.”<br /><br /><br />
        He continued to remain silent and let her speak. There were other Awakeners in the vicinity, but all of them stayed away.<br /><br /><br />
        The moment was a time for just the two of them to talk.<br /><br /><br />
        “Chief Secretary,” Song-yi said.<br /><br /><br />
        “Yes, Master Jin?”<br /><br /><br />
        “That man… he is, in fact, my brother. His eyes, his actions, his nuances, it's all him. He's the Shi-hu I used to depend on when we were younger. It's just…” Song-yi
        offered him another awkward smile. “He came back too strong.”<br /><br /><br />
