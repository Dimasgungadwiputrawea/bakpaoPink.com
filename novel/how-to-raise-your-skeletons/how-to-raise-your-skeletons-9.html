        ◈ How to Raise Your Skeletons
      </h2>

      <div class="garis"></div>

      <h2 class="garis2">Chapter 9</h2>

      <p>
        As I suspected, the old man harbored a deep ‘resentment’ to teach someone. He had a desire.<br /><br /><br />
        In truth, it wasn't that there were no suitable candidates.<br /><br /><br />
        According to his memories, many talented individuals existed even in the mysterious other world.<br /><br /><br />
        If he had gathered them and split the teachings, he could have passed on his knowledge to future generations.<br /><br /><br />
        But the old man had a desire. A singular legacy. He wanted one person to inherit his vast abilities and knowledge.<br /><br /><br />
        [The skill 'Memory Recreation' (S-rank), has ended.]<br /><br /><br />
        —Flash!<br /><br /><br />
        The peculiar déjà vu vanished. The scenery changed again.<br /><br /><br />
        [The ‘Master of All Techniques’ is staring at you.]<br /><br /><br />
        “Hah!”<br /><br /><br />
        I felt a suffocating gaze.<br /><br /><br />
        It wasn't just a saying; the pressure was so intense that I could barely breathe.<br /><br /><br />
        But.<br /><br /><br />
        I smiled.<br /><br /><br />
        I felt like a perverted psycho for smiling in this situation, but I couldn't help it.<br /><br /><br />
        Because I see hope now.<br /><br /><br />
        The old man’s initial words when he saw me were dismissive. He said I was worse than Gi Soyul and wasn’t worth his time. He wanted to throw me out quickly.<br /><br /><br />
        However.<br /><br /><br />
        That old soul was now clearly staring at me. He hadn’t violently subdued me and tossed me out like he did with other hunters and Gi Soyul.<br /><br /><br />
        That alone gave me hope.<br /><br /><br />
        Soon, the old, white-haired man's mouth opened.<br /><br /><br />
        “You.”<br /><br /><br />
        I felt an overwhelming presence. Was this the immense power of someone who stood at the pinnacle of a world?<br /><br /><br />
        “Did you peer into my soul? Interesting fellow.”<br /><br /><br />
        [The ‘Master of All Techniques’ is curious about you.]<br /><br /><br />
        “Yes, I did…! Hah!” I immediately replied.<br /><br /><br />
        It was hard to open my mouth, but I tried to speak as loudly as possible.<br /><br /><br />
        Gi Soyul had given one single chance. In other words, this was a one-life challenge.<br /><br /><br />
        If this old man is indeed looking for a disciple…! If I can inherit his vast power and knowledge…!<br /><br /><br />
        It must be me. I can’t let anyone else take it. If I missed this chance, I would regret it forever.<br /><br /><br />
        I instinctively knew that this was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. If I could have this old man who even toyed with rankers as my master, it would be the greatest
        fortune!<br /><br /><br />
        “However.”<br /><br /><br />
        The old man's voice, the ‘Master of All Techniques,’ was somewhat cold.<br /><br /><br />
        He stared at me for a moment before shaking his head.<br /><br /><br />
        “Other than being somewhat interesting, you have nothing. You’re worthless. You lack everything to contain my knowledge.”<br /><br /><br />
        “Hmph!”<br /><br /><br />
        The old man's aura grew even stronger.<br /><br /><br />
        My whole body trembled as if I were being electrocuted.<br /><br /><br />
        This can’t be. I can’t let it end like this. I have to persuade this old man somehow. Even if my whole body melts from enduring it.<br /><br /><br />
        “No, Elder!” I opened my eyes wide and stared directly at the old man. “If you continue like this, you’ll never find a disciple! You’ll remain a ghost forever, unable
        to resolve your resentment! People will remember you as a stubborn ghost filled with obstinacy and bullheadedness!”<br /><br /><br />
        “What?”<br /><br /><br />
        The old man's aura became fierce at my provocation.<br /><br /><br />
        “You insolent brat. I’ve spared ants like you with my boundless generosity. Do I need to break one of your legs for you to come to your senses?”<br /><br /><br />
        “Wait! Please listen! You’ve mastered all techniques. The people of this world struggle to master even one in their lifetime!”<br /><br /><br />
        “Hmph, impossible. The world is vast, and time is long. Surely, there will be another genius like me.”<br /><br /><br />
        The old man’s self-praise momentarily stunned me. But I had gained time. The old man was clearly having a conversation with me. That alone was a significant
        achievement.<br /><br /><br />
        “Look at the woman who came in earlier. Can you believe she is one of the strongest in this world?”<br /><br /><br />
        “What?!”<br /><br /><br />
        For the first time, the old man’s face twisted. His face showed genuine shock. It seemed he was truly surprised by my claim that Gi Soyul was one of the strongest in
        this world.<br /><br /><br />
        This is… a bit demoralizing.<br /><br /><br />
        Considering that a ranker like Gi Soyul was my ultimate goal, the old man’s reaction stung.<br /><br /><br />
        Anyway.<br /><br /><br />
        It seemed I had caught his attention. Now, to reel him in.<br /><br /><br />
        From the perspective of an old man searching for a worthy candidate, it would be hard to accept that someone he rejected was one of the strongest in this world. After
        all, his world had many who surpassed her.<br /><br /><br />
        “Impossible! How can she be one of the strongest with such skill level? What kind of messed-up world is this?” The old man exclaimed, shocked.<br /><br /><br />
        “You! You’re not trying to trick me, are you?”<br /><br /><br />
        “Look into my eyes! Do these look like the eyes of a dishonest person? You were known as a sage for centuries. Surely you can tell if I'm lying!"<br /><br /><br />
        I spoke with conviction, leveraging the information I gained from ‘Memory Recreation.’ I believed a ranker was akin to a world’s strongest, so I had confidence in my
        words.<br /><br /><br />
        “Hmm.”<br /><br /><br />
        The old man furrowed his brow. He must have realized I was telling the truth. Even in his spectral form, the old man’s wisdom was intact.<br /><br /><br />
        “You… truly mean it. Even if she’s not the absolute strongest, she’s a highly regarded warrior. How could such a skill be considered one of the best? What a cruel
        fate. The disciple I longed for so long, will I not find them?” The old man clicked his tongue.<br /><br /><br />
        The fierce light in his eyes dimmed, replaced by futility and emptiness.<br /><br /><br />
        Consequently, the oppressive pressure slightly lifted.<br /><br /><br />
        “Hmph? Huff, hah…!” I finally caught my breath.<br /><br /><br />
        I breathed heavily in the small gap.<br /><br /><br />
        And then… I instinctively knew it was my chance.<br /><br /><br />
        “Fuu…! Elder!” I shouted with all my might. “If no one meets your standards, how about using me?”<br /><br /><br />
        “Using you?”<br /><br /><br />
        “Yes! Pass your abilities to me!”<br /><br /><br />
        “Ha, to you?” The old man snorted. “Do you expect me to take you as my disciple? I thought of you as insolent, but now you have also proved to be shameless. I’d rather
        teach garbage than teach you.”<br /><br /><br />
        His blunt words stabbed my heart, but I didn’t stop persuading him.<br /><br /><br />
        “Listen! I’m not asking you to teach me directly!”<br /><br /><br />
        “…Then?”<br /><br /><br />
        “I have a unique ability.”<br /><br /><br />
        I quickly checked my status window.<br /><br /><br />
        [Hunter: Joo Donghoon]<br /><br /><br />
        [Energy: 100/100]<br /><br /><br />
        Okay. No abnormalities.<br /><br /><br />
        I clenched my fists tightly.<br /><br /><br />
        [Skill: ‘Summon Ordinary Skeleton (D-rank) activated.]<br /><br /><br />
        That’s right. My proposal to the old man didn’t involve me but my children—my skeletons.<br /><br /><br />
        [10 energy consumed.]<br /><br /><br />
        [‘Bonehead 1’ summoned.]<br /><br /><br />
        [10 energy consumed.]<br /><br /><br />
        [‘Bonehead 2’ summoned.]<br /><br /><br />
        [10 energy consumed.]<br /><br /><br />
        [‘Bonehead 3’ summoned.]<br /><br /><br />
        …<br /><br /><br />
        [10 energy consumed.]<br /><br /><br />
        [‘Bonehead 10’ summoned.]<br /><br /><br />
        From Bonehead 1 to Bonehead 10. This time, I used all my energy to summon ten skeletons, my maximum.<br /><br /><br />
        This was a gamble.<br /><br /><br />
        “Elder, surely you can see their potential?”<br /><br /><br />
        “…”<br /><br /><br />
        I gambled on the hope that the old man could recognize the limitless potential of my growing skeletons.<br /><br /><br />
        The skeletons had indeed grown from E-rank to D-rank. If so, they could reach C-rank, B-rank, and perhaps even S-rank or beyond.<br /><br /><br />
        The method might be unknown now, but that alone should make their ‘potential’ evident.<br /><br /><br />
        “From Bonehead 1 to Bonehead 10, these ten have unique abilities. It’ll be easier for you to teach them. Do you want a single successor? Don’t worry. Even if all these
        grow, I’ll be the only one to inherit it all!”<br /><br /><br />
        It could be nonsense. But this was my only answer. They were all I had, my ‘unique authority.’ They were essentially me.<br /><br /><br />
        It’s a risk worth taking.<br /><br /><br />
        The old man had to choose. Would he live in regret forever? Or would he take the second-best option?<br /><br /><br />
        “What do you think? These undead grow. They don’t feel pain, so they’ll be more enduring than anyone and more challenging than anyone because they’re fearless, making
        them the best students. They’ll take your advice and teachings without hesitation.”<br /><br /><br />
        “…”<br /><br /><br />
        The old, white-haired man remained silent. He stared at the skeletons with a blank expression, lost in thought.<br /><br /><br />
        “…”<br /><br /><br />
        So I stayed silent, too. I instinctively knew that saying more wouldn’t change his decision. The old man moved based solely on his judgment.<br /><br /><br />
        I quietly waited for his choice.<br /><br /><br />
        “Oho.”<br /><br /><br />
        Finally, a smile tugged at the old man’s lips.<br /><br /><br />
        “How amusing… The successor I sought wasn’t human but undead.”<br /><br /><br />
        “…!”<br /><br /><br />
        He stepped forward slowly and gently touched the skeletons with a calm gaze.<br /><br /><br />
        “Their potential is truly immense. They must have been exceptional warriors in life. I’ve always wanted such disciples. Why only now… tsk.”<br /><br /><br />
        His reaction was awe-inspiring. Was this how it felt to win the lottery?<br /><br /><br />
        It turns out my skeletons’ potential was impressive enough for the old man to praise them.<br /><br /><br />
        “Teaching more than one is a bit tricky, but… fine. I suppose I must compromise.”<br /><br /><br />
        The fierce pressure had vanished. Now, I could see the surroundings.<br /><br /><br />
        That’s right. This place was the snowy mountain where the old man’s life had ended.<br /><br /><br />
        [You have fulfilled the hidden condition.]<br /><br /><br />
        The place was soaked with his resentment and also the place where he would release that resentment.<br /><br /><br />
        [This is the hidden condition for ‘Stage: An Elderly Man with White Hair Filled with Deep Resentment’!]<br /><br /><br />
        The old man’s gaze returned to me. He seemed very pleased.<br /><br /><br />
        —Gulp.<br /><br /><br />
        As I swallowed, he spoke.<br /><br /><br />
        “I’ll trust your words. I’ll trust the determination in your eyes. So promise me. No matter what trials come, you’ll inherit all I possess. You’ll leave a mark of ‘me’
        somewhere in this world.”<br /><br /><br />
        [Condition: His recognition]<br /><br /><br />
        - To be recognized by the transcendent of another world, ‘Master of All Techniques,’ you must reach a certain level.<br /><br /><br />
        - Convince him.<br /><br /><br />
        I felt the desperation in his tone. How badly must he have wanted it for his resentment to linger even after death?<br /><br /><br />
        “I won’t miss this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. I’ll inherit it no matter what,” I replied sincerely.<br /><br /><br />
        “Good.”<br /><br /><br />
        The old man responded cheerfully.<br /><br /><br />
        [Congratulations!]<br /><br /><br />
        [You have cleared the ‘Stage: An Elderly Man with White Hair Filled with Deep Resentment’!]<br /><br /><br />
        Ah…<br /><br /><br />
        I was overwhelmed.<br /><br /><br />
        Is this real? Did I clear this dungeon that even a ranker couldn’t? Did I clear it on my first try? Truly?<br /><br /><br />
        —Thud!<br /><br /><br />
        As the tension released, my legs gave out.<br /><br /><br />
        [Receiving clear rewards!]<br /><br /><br />
        Honestly, this was the day I would gain the greatest fortune of my life.<br /><br /><br />
        [You have exhausted all your energy!]<br /><br /><br />
        [Your body has reached its limit!]<br /><br /><br />
        “…”<br /><br /><br />
        And soon, I lost consciousness.<br /><br /><br />
