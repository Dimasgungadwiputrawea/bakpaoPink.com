        ◈ How to Raise Your Skeletons
      </h2>

      <div class="garis"></div>

      <h2 class="garis2">Chapter 10</h2>

      <p></p>
      <p>
        “Hmm?”<br /><br /><br />
        When I opened my eyes, the glaring fluorescent lights hurt my vision. The smell of disinfectant tickled my nose…<br /><br /><br />
        A hospital?<br /><br /><br />
        Ah, right. I had cleared the dungeon, hadn’t I? The old man eventually accepted my proposal.<br /><br /><br />
        The message of the ‘stage clear’ clearly confirmed it.<br /><br /><br />
        After that, I must have lost consciousness.<br /><br /><br />
        “…”<br /><br /><br />
        As I frowned and tried to adjust to the bright world…<br /><br /><br />
        “Hm?”<br /><br /><br />
        I felt a piercing gaze from my surroundings.<br /><br /><br />
        When I forced my eyes open, a young lady in a formal suit with her arms crossed was looking down at me.<br /><br /><br />
        “You’re awake,” she said bluntly.<br /><br /><br />
        “Who… are you? Huh?” I tilted my head and asked.<br /><br /><br />
        Then I opened my eyes wide in surprise.<br /><br /><br />
        It was a face I remembered. The golden badge on her waist was an indication that she was…<br /><br /><br />
        Gi Soyul?<br /><br /><br />
        Wow.<br /><br /><br />
        I was impressed. She had a completely different vibe from the last time in battle gear. She had a formidable warrior look back then, but now she seemed like a cold,
        professional career woman.<br /><br /><br />
        “Since you’re awake, let’s introduce ourselves again. I’m Gi Soyul, the vice guild master of the Parang Guild, also known as ‘Dark Empress,’” Gi Soyul spoke calmly.<br /><br /><br />
        I nodded. “I see. But…”<br /><br /><br />
        Why was she here?<br /><br /><br />
        I quickly scanned our surroundings. There were only the two of us in the hospital room.<br /><br /><br />
        What was this? Could it be that she was here to kill me because I stole her opportunity?<br /><br /><br />
        It wasn’t impossible. She was the queen of assassins. Even if she took my head here, she could do it without leaving any evidence.<br /><br /><br />
        “Honestly, I was surprised. The boss was truly unclearable. I couldn’t have imagined Mr. Porter clearing that dungeon, not even in one go.”<br /><br /><br />
        Despite my fears, her demeanor remained polite.<br /><br /><br />
        But I didn’t lower my guard. You never know; she might be a psycho who kills with a smile while being polite.<br /><br /><br />
        “…Why are you looking at me with those eyes?” Gi Soyul frowned as she sensed my wary gaze.<br /><br /><br />
        Afraid of offending her, I quickly shook my head.<br /><br /><br />
        “No, it’s just… I’m curious why the vice guild master of a major guild came to see me on her own.”<br /><br /><br />
        “Of course, because I’m curious too.”<br /><br /><br />
        “Huh?”<br /><br /><br />
        “How did you clear that absurd dungeon? And if you did, what reward did you get? Did you become the old man’s disciple? And so on.”<br /><br /><br />
        “Ah…”<br /><br /><br />
        I pondered after hearing her questions.<br /><br /><br />
        Her questions were valid. After all, the dungeon ownership was hers, and I was given a single chance. From her perspective, it was like some random guy came and stole
        her opportunity!<br /><br /><br />
        A more violent ranker might have already killed me.<br /><br /><br />
        The fact that she wasn’t angry showed how magnanimous she was.<br /><br /><br />
        Also.<br /><br /><br />
        The world is harsh. It’s harsh to the extreme.<br /><br /><br />
        If it becomes known that a rookie like me gained an incredible opportunity, I could become a target. Whether it could be a crazy person out of jealousy or an
        underground group trying to cut down a budding talent, I must always be cautious.<br /><br /><br />
        “Hm, porter? What are you thinking so deeply about?”<br /><br /><br />
        “Oh, Dark Empress, before I answer. Could I know how the news articles about this dungeon exploration were written?”<br /><br /><br />
        She looked at me with an unexpected expression.<br /><br /><br />
        “I think I understand what you’re worried about. You don’t have to worry too much. We have reported that the Parang Guild’s advance team successfully cleared the
        dungeon. We also got confidentiality agreements from all the survivors.”<br /><br /><br />
        “What?”<br /><br /><br />
        Does that mean the public doesn’t know that I was the one who cleared the dungeon?<br /><br /><br />
        Ah, I was genuinely moved by the considerate action.<br /><br /><br />
        I bowed my head respectfully.<br /><br /><br />
        “Thank you for your consideration, Dark Empress.”<br /><br /><br />
        “You’re more mature than you look, Mr. Porter. Most hunters are dying to show off their achievements to the world.”<br /><br /><br />
        “Safety comes first. Safety first, safety second.”<br /><br /><br />
        “No need to thank me. This is also a matter of pride for the Parang Guild.”<br /><br /><br />
        “Oh?” I blinked as she chuckled.<br /><br /><br />
        “Would anyone believe that a porter, an E-rank mercenary, was the MVP when there was a ranker?”<br /><br /><br />
        “Ah…”<br /><br /><br />
        The point was simple. We’re embarrassed, so we’re keeping it quiet. But understand, you might get killed if you show off about it.<br /><br /><br />
        Anyway, I was grateful.<br /><br /><br />
        However.<br /><br /><br />
        There was something to consider. Because I was given a chance once, do I have an obligation to tell her everything about my capabilities?<br /><br /><br />
        The reason she’s being generous and relaxed is because she’s strong.<br /><br /><br />
        But I’m weak. I don’t have the luxury to expose my full strength to anyone.<br /><br /><br />
        “But, Dark Empress.”<br /><br /><br />
        “Yes, Mr. Porter?”<br /><br /><br />
        “How long have I been unconscious?”<br /><br /><br />
        “Hmm, it’s been three days since you came out of the dungeon, so three days.”<br /><br /><br />
        Damn, I’ve been out for a while.<br /><br /><br />
        I looked at her with a troubled expression.<br /><br /><br />
        “Honestly, I’m still not sure what’s what, and I haven’t even figured out the rewards yet… I might need some time to give you a proper answer.”<br /><br /><br />
        I was being truthful when I said this. Our conversation had started the moment I woke up.<br /><br /><br />
        “Hmm… I see.” Gi Soyul narrowed her eyes.<br /><br /><br />
        She suspected I was dodging the question, but she seemed to understand.<br /><br /><br />
        “Give me a little time to organize my thoughts, and I’ll let you know.”<br /><br /><br />
        “Hm.”<br /><br /><br />
        “Don’t worry about me running away. What kind of hunter in this world could ever escape the eyes of the Dark Empress?”<br /><br /><br />
        “Alright. If you’d cooperate, I’d appreciate it. I’ll come back once you’ve sorted things out.”<br /><br /><br />
        Gi Soyul coolly acknowledged and left the room.<br /><br /><br />
        Her overwhelming presence disappeared.<br /><br /><br />
        “Phew.”<br /><br /><br />
        I felt a bit relieved.<br /><br /><br />
        Damn, life has been quite spectacular lately. Suddenly encountering an orc, awakening after three years, meeting a ranker. And a strange dungeon on top of that.<br /><br /><br />
        If I made one wrong choice here, I could come in conflict with Parang.<br /><br /><br />
        Or, conversely, I could have a good relationship with them.<br /><br /><br />
        Thinking that, I turned over in bed.<br /><br /><br />
        [Check your clear rewards!]<br /><br /><br />
        Oh, right.<br /><br /><br />
        I hadn’t yet opened the message because I passed out.<br /><br /><br />
        Now was the time to check it.<br /><br /><br />

        [Receiving rewards!]<br /><br /><br />
        [Congratulations!]<br /><br /><br />
        [Permanent increase of energy by 20.]<br /><br /><br />
        [You have acquired the skill 'Teaching of All Techniques' (S-rank)!]<br /><br /><br />
        “Wow!” I couldn’t help but shout.<br /><br /><br />
        Goosebumps rose all over my body.<br /><br /><br />
        A permanent increase in energy was an incredible reward.<br /><br /><br />
        And another S-rank skill.<br /><br /><br />
        It’s hard to obtain even one S-rank skill in one’s lifetime. And I had already gotten two in a short time.<br /><br /><br />
        [Hunter: Joo Donghoon]<br /><br /><br />
        [Alias: X]<br /><br /><br />
        [Energy: 120/120]<br /><br /><br />
        [Unique authority: Cursed Necromancer]<br /><br /><br />
        [Rank: D]<br /><br /><br />
        [Effect]<br /><br /><br />
        - You possess the profession of a necromancer, capable of handling dead souls. You can use fearsome spirits and toxic substances to subdue opponents. However, you are
        cursed.<br /><br /><br />
        - You can only summon skeletons.<br /><br /><br />
        [Skills]<br /><br /><br />
        - Summon Awakened Skeleton (D-rank)<br /><br /><br />
        - Memory Recreation (S-rank)<br /><br /><br />
        - Teaching of All Techniques (S-rank)<br /><br /><br />
        This is crazy.<br /><br /><br />
        Now I understood why veterans were so obsessed with dungeons.<br /><br /><br />
        My status window had filled up significantly.<br /><br /><br />
        I felt my chest swell with pride.<br /><br /><br />
        ‘First, let’s check Memory Recreation.’<br /><br /><br />
        [Skill: Memory Recreation]<br /><br /><br />
        [Rank: S]<br /><br /><br />
        [Effect 1: Consume 50 energy to read the memory of the dead.]<br /><br /><br />
        Just what could this possibly be? It seemed underwhelming. Yet it was rated S-rank.<br /><br /><br />
        It was a hidden skill only found by encountering a ‘cursed’ soul.<br /><br /><br />
        I was curious but could not know now, so I moved on to the next one.<br /><br /><br />
        If I can use it to clear dungeons, it’ll be fine.<br /><br /><br />
        This dungeon was cleared thanks to seeing the old man’s memories. I’m sure I’ll find another use for it someday.<br /><br /><br />
        Next, Teaching of All Techniques.<br /><br /><br />
        I calmed my excited heart and checked the next skill.<br /><br /><br />
        [Skill: Teaching of All Techniques]<br /><br /><br />
        [Rank: S]<br /><br /><br />
        [Effect 1: Consume 20 energy to summon the ‘Master of All Techniques,’ the one who had dominated the other world, for 60 minutes.]<br /><br /><br />
        [Effect 2: The summoned ‘Master of All Techniques’ cannot exert physical force in this world. He can only pass on his knowledge for a limited time.]<br /><br /><br />
        [Effect 3: The cooldown for this skill is 24 hours.]<br /><br /><br />
        [Effect 4: Only the skill user can perceive the ‘Master of All Techniques.’]<br /><br /><br />
        —Gulp.<br /><br /><br />
        I swallowed hard.<br /><br /><br />
        A transcendent who dominated another world…<br /><br /><br />
        My heart swelled with awe. Finally, my skeletons had a top-tier instructor, even more potent than any rankers.<br /><br /><br />
        “Damn it, this isn’t the time to be lying around.”<br /><br /><br />
        I swiftly pulled out the intravenous drip. This wasn’t the time to be receiving fluids. I was about to go crazy if I didn’t check it out as soon as possible.<br /><br /><br />
        —Swoosh, swoosh.<br /><br /><br />
        I hastily put on the clothes hanging beside the bed and stepped out.<br /><br /><br />
        “Uh, Patient Joo Donghoon?” a flustered nurse called out, but I was in a hurry.<br /><br /><br />
        “Kyaa! No, you need to rest for now…”<br /><br /><br />
        “Sorry. I have urgent matters. Charge the hospital bill to my name.”<br /><br /><br />
        My heart was pounding.<br /><br /><br />
        “Their potential is truly immense. They must have been exceptional warriors during life. I’ve always wanted such disciples. Why only now… tsk.”<br /><br /><br />
        The old man’s voice still echoed vividly in my ears.<br /><br /><br />
        Is this how parents feel when their children are praised? I couldn’t wait to get them trained.<br /><br /><br />
        * * *<br /><br /><br />
        [Using skill ‘Teaching of All Techniques’ (S-rank).]<br /><br /><br />
        [Consuming 20 energy.]<br /><br /><br />
        [Summoning ‘Master of All Techniques.’]<br /><br /><br />
        When I reached the usual vacant lot, I used the skill.<br /><br /><br />
        —Thud!<br /><br /><br />
        “Ouch!”<br /><br /><br />
        A tremendous pain struck my forehead. It hurt so much tears welled up, and I saw stars in the sky.<br /><br /><br />
        When I regained my senses, the old man was glaring at me.<br /><br /><br />
        “You insolent brat! You promised to inherit everything from me, and you’ve just been slacking off? Do you think you can keep up with me with that attitude?”<br /><br /><br />
        “No, wait, elder… I summoned you right after waking up…”<br /><br /><br />
        It felt unfair.<br /><br /><br />
        No, wait.<br /><br /><br />
        The old man isn’t supposed to be able to exert physical force in this world.<br /><br /><br />
        “Still a novice, you are. Your expression is very readable. Tsk tsk. Since we’re connected mentally, of course I can inflict pain upon you.”<br /><br /><br />
        The old man shook his head in disapproval.<br /><br /><br />
        He seemed to have a very tiresome, old-fashioned style…<br /><br /><br />
        “Anyway, since you’ve summoned me, let’s start right away. There’s no time.”<br /><br /><br />
        “Yes, sir.” I nodded, answering promptly to his urging.<br /><br /><br />
        “Do I summon the skeletons as promised?”<br /><br /><br />
        “No need.”<br /><br /><br />
        “Pardon?”<br /><br /><br />
        “Today, we decide what to learn first. I’ve assessed the talents of those ten, but the problem is you.”<br /><br /><br />
        “…Me? What do you mean?” I opened my eyes wide.<br /><br /><br />
        The ten he meant must mean the abilities of my skeletons. Could he have assessed the talents of those who hadn’t awakened yet?<br /><br /><br />
        And more importantly.<br /><br /><br />
        Why am I the problem? Does he intend to teach me too?<br /><br /><br />
        The old man said bluntly, “Do you know why it’s called the Teaching of All Techniques?”<br /><br /><br />
        “…?”<br /><br /><br />
        “I earned this title by mastering countless talents. Do you think I’d be satisfied with teaching only ten techniques?” He grinned wickedly.<br /><br /><br />
        I suddenly felt uneasy. A cold, unsettling feeling.<br /><br /><br />
        “So just teach the skeletons.”<br /><br /><br />
        “No, their talents are focused in one direction. Teaching them other skills would be pointless.”<br /><br /><br />
        “Then?”<br /><br /><br />
        “Why ask? Of course, you’ll learn them.”<br /><br /><br />
        “Huh? But you said my talent was trash…”<br /><br /><br />
        “Quiet. Since you promised, you’ll inherit all of my techniques. If it doesn’t work, I’ll make it work. Turning trash into a near-genius can also be considered a
        technique. Fortunately, I can still inflict pain on you.”<br /><br /><br />
        What the hell is happening all of a sudden?<br /><br /><br />
