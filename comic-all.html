            <p>
              I was a being that ruled over death. It took me a hundred years to come to a realization. A human should live a human life. One shouldn't rule over something
              like that.

              Look in any fantasy novel, and you'll find that regression is a guaranteed cheat key! But what about the ability of Infinite Regression? There’d be no need to
              worry about bad endings, not when the protagonist can simply reset to reach that eventual happy ending. “Cheat code, my ass.” I tried it myself just to find out
              otherwise. The myths of regressors’ successes depicted in all those novels are actually fake… It was all just vile propaganda! “This run is doomed too.” This is
              not a story of success. It’s a tale of the aftermath of failures. Thus begins the heartfelt biography of a man with 1,183 runs of experience!

              His talent was forged on the battlefield, but before he could fully develop it, he died. However, when he opened his eyes again, he realized he had been reborn
              as Dane Sogres, the youngest son of a prestigious count. The talent he now possessed... was not limited to just one field?! A talent in spearmanship,
              assassination, magic, summoning, and even swordsmanship—which he had not been able to develop fully before! He can finally nurture his endless talent in the
              embrace of the happy family he had always longed for.
